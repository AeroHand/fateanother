FAQ

Q) I started the game, but the hero is frozen!
A) All heroes are paused until game starts, which is around 1:15 to 1:20. If they are still frozen after then, do report the bug.

Q) Where can I finish my Master unit?
A) Right bottom side of the map.

Q) How do I buy items with hotkey?
A) You move through column with QWER and select a row with 1~9 button. This is quite terrible I know.

Q) I get 'Cannot Take Items' error when trying to buy item! 
A) Select your hero and try again. A unit cannot carry an item.

Q) Can I change camera zoom?
A) No, in Dota 2 all players' camera vision range is bound to one variable, meaning everyone will be forced to use your zoom. 

Q) Why is C scroll stock running out so fast?
A) In Dota 2 the stock in shop is team-bound, not personal and there's no way to do anything about it at the moment. It is very likely that someone else have hogged all scrolls before you get your hands on them.
